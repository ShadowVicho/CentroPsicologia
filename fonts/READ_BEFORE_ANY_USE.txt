Formale Script is a classy calligraphic script. 

Its flowing lines give it a feel of sophistication and elegance. The high contrast between thick and thin gives it a very stylish touch. Imagine the words in the titles of a black-and-white vintage movie or as the lettering on a fancy wine bottle. 

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

Mans Greback created this formal yet inviting script, designed with a high level of detail.
